      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My pronouns are he/him/his. If I could choose to be any animal other than a human I'd be a wolf. The wolf is a hardy creature that doesn't shy away from a challenge. A wolf is hungry in appetite but also desire - it will roam large distances for food and eat up to 20 pounds in one sitting. That's my kind of feast! They are social animals that work cooperatively in a team. I mean who hasn't howled at the moon like a wolf before?   </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Kekaha, HI</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Cooking ~ Trying new restaurants ~ Listening to podcasts ~ Reading ~ Playing & watching football ~ Training Brazilian JiuJitsu ~ Lifting weights ~ Running ~ Netflix-ing/Hulu-ing/HBO Max-ing ~ Chillin like a villian </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Create innovative tech products, software, or services that will help people live better, healthier lives (while upholding a good work-life balance!)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bellingham, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Many reasons! Through computer programming I can be a part of the booming technology sector. My curiosity in how technology works. COVID-19 has shown that being able to work remotely is an underrated advantage. Continuous learning opportunities. Project-based work structure and the feeling of excitement and accomplishment after solving a problem. Having the knowledge and tools as a web developer can allow me to build what I can think up which is super cool!</p>
