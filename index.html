      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page! My pronouns are he/him/his. I've had the belief that I wanted to work in medicine or technology so I got my B.S. in Cell & Molecular Biology and for the past year I've worked as a certified nursing assistant in a hospital gaining patient care experience so that I may apply to medical school. I learned a lot about myself and healthcare while working and around Thanksgivng 2020 a thought crossed my mind, "I do not really enjoy taking care of sick people". So after a bit of "soul searching" and researching I switched to my backup plan, technology, which is how I ended up here! Web Development is completely new to me and I have zero coding experience apart from the prework. I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone and learning as much as I can to pursue an exciting and rewarding career in web development! </p>

      <p>Having the knowledge and tools of a web developer allows me to build what I think up which is super cool! I'll be able to create products, software, or services that will help people live better, healthier lives (while also upholding a good work-life balance!) </p>
